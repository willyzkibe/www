## Download and install <t>MetaTrader 5</t>

To start, you need to open a demo account on any <t>MetaTrader 5 (MT5)</t> Broker of your choice. If you do not know any MT5 Broker, just search for <t>"MetaTrader 5 Broker"</t> in your favorite search engine. If you do not want to register a demo account with a broker, you can simply download <t>MetaTrader 5</t> on the [official website](https://www.metatrader5.com/en).

<t>MetaTrader</t> is designed for <t>Windows</t>, but there are ways to install it on other operating systems like Linux or macOS using [PlayOnMac](https://www.playonmac.com/en/) or [PlayOnLinux](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/).

## Download and install your first Trading Robot

Download a [Trading Robot](/experts) of your choice to your hard disk. All <t>Expert Advisors</t> and indicators have the file extension ex5. Open the directory where you have installed Metatrader 5 and copy the file into the MQL5/experts folder, then restart <t>MetaTrader</t>. After that, you will have access to your new Trading Robot inside Metatrader 5.

## Optimize your <t>Expert Advisor</t>

Once you have downloaded and installed your EA, you need to optimize it for the symbol and timeframe you want to use it on. For this, we use the integrated [Strategy Tester](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/automated-trading/strategy-tester). You can open the Strategy Tester by typing <t>Ctrl+R</t>. A detailed guide on how to use the Strategy Tester will be available here in the future.
